# Islandora DOI DDI

## Overview

Submodule of the Islandora DOI framework module that persists DOIs in an `<IDNo agency="doi">` element within the object's DDI datastream. This module also provides a function that checks for the existence of a DOI in a DDI datastream.

This is a clone of Mark Jordan's Islandora DOI MODS module, with small changes to work with DDI.
